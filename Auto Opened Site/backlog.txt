Problem log:
popup.html
    - Refused to load the script 'https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy 
    directive: "script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*". 
    Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
    - Error: 'content_security_policy.extension_pages': Insecure CSP value "https://cdn.tailwindcss.com" in directive 'script-src'.
    Could not load manifest.
    - cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production. To use Tailwind CSS in production, install it as a PostCSS 
    plugin or use the Tailwind CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
    - Display finish ui accordingly.
    - Check validity of target site and destination site.
